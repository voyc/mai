user profile
	Set superuser flag in user profile.
	Flags: Student, Coach, Super
	Sam's internal clock (cron) can remind superuser to run tests, backups, analysis.  Can check results of backups and server-side analysis.
	build a personality profile on each user.
		use sengen to ask questions to fill out the profile

Grammar/sengen
	10 ways to say hello
	Which we choose is based on personality and mood, both of which depend on history.

Story options
	Wordlist
	Headings, subheadings
	Exposition paragraphs
	Drill by paragraph

drill
	checkAnswer
		ignore pronunciation

			leading consonant is ย, is this a consonant cluster?
			fix in parse and in checkAnswer
		display rule for exceptions: 
			low-class sonorant raised to high class by ห
			low-class sonorant raised to high class อ, four words: อยู่
			special case exception, like ก็

			observer events - publish/subscribe 
			html events - load, click, etc.
			hist navigation - browser click/back/forward
		navigation to these components
			x home chat

revive collectWords()
	not needed until we do keyboard drills, ie glyph drills
	rewrite dictionary.iterate()

dict/mean
	mean: remove s and l (abandon source info)
	dict: set lvl
	re-purpose cpm and tlm
		pm: parse manual, because the parser fails
		pf: parse fixed, test case, to test and train the parser
		both fields govern cp,ru,tl
		build testsuite by reading dictionary
	dict: add origin: e:english, s:sanskrit, p:pali, f:french

tests
	parse testing
		compare current parse output to dict.cp and dict.ru and dict.tl
		do the whole dict, or some subset of search results
	dictionary where cpm = manual and tlm = manual
		to test for improvements in parse algorithm
	how far off is our dict now? do we need sql output?	
	these tests must be run on the client.  not server. no cron.
		must be launched by human.
		sam's internal clock can advise superuser when to run tests

write dynamic translit function in Dictionary or Noam.  Current translit function in Dictionary is static.

consonant cluster after leading upright vowel, positions reversed

consonant cluster, inherent short a, two syllables
	if first consonant high and second low, low becomes high
	examples tanon, kanom, samud

silent tone mark
	เกณฑ์

silent i on final consonant
	examples Suvarnabhumi, Bhumibol

loi, at all

trailing อ
	ถือ
	มือ
	ชื่อ
	หนังสือ	

อ = aw or silent, is it in position of vowel or consonant?
lc = อ, consonant placeholder, skip translit of lc, vowel only
psql -U voyccom_jhagstrand -d voyccom_mai -c "select * from  mai.thaidict where substring(thai,1,1) = 'อ';"

เอง  1269


psql -U voyccom_jhagstrand -d voyccom_mai -c "select id, thai, level, details from mai.thaidict where pos = '' and eng = '' and details != '';"




parse
pos, eng
translit table: given lc, vp, fc, tn per syllable; what about multi-syllable words?
implement translit as separate function
if there is a final consonant, there must also be an endx rule


translit of lc comes from dictionary
translit of fc comes from rules
translit of vowels comes from vowel pattern table
tone calculation can be fixed
translit can be table driven and customizeable
add รร to vowel pattern table
translit table


consonant cluster, presence of tonemark unclusters these consonants
final cluster nt, t has to be silent because n as already stopped the sound
 m    |            2 | จันทร์    | n   | Moon        |  347

ditto dri is final cluster, d stops the sound ri is silent
 m    |            2 | กษัตริย์   | n   | king        |  154

weird, what is the h doing in here
 m    |            2 | พราหมณ์  | n   | Brahman     |  787


ทรัพย์
จันทร์
ราษฎร์

เบอร์	buuhrM	pronunciation?
พราหมณ์	phraamM		leading cluster pr, final cluster silent h+m, silent mark
จอห์น	jaawnM	silent consonant is NOT the last letter in the word
