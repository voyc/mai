write dynamic translit function in Dictionary or Noam.  Current translit function in Dictionary is static.

consonant cluster after leading upright vowel, positions reversed

consonant cluster, inherent short a, two syllables
	if first consonant high and second low, low becomes high
	examples tanon, kanom, samud

silent tone mark
	เกณฑ์

silent i on final consonant
	examples Suvarnabhumi, Bhumibol

loi, at all

trailing อ
	ถือ
	มือ
	ชื่อ
	หนังสือ	

อ = aw or silent, is it in position of vowel or consonant?
lc = อ, consonant placeholder, skip translit of lc, vowel only
psql -U voyccom_jhagstrand -d voyccom_mai -c "select * from  mai.thaidict where substring(thai,1,1) = 'อ';"
เอก 1268
เอง  1269


psql -U voyccom_jhagstrand -d voyccom_mai -c "select id, thai, level, details from mai.thaidict where pos = '' and eng = '' and details != '';"




parse
pos, eng
translit table: given lc, vp, fc, tn per syllable; what about multi-syllable words?
implement translit as separate function
if there is a final consonant, there must also be an endx rule


translit of lc comes from dictionary
translit of fc comes from rules
translit of vowels comes from vowel pattern table
tone calculation can be fixed
translit can be table driven and customizeable
add รร to vowel pattern table
translit table


consonant cluster, presence of tonemark unclusters these consonants
final cluster nt, t has to be silent because n as already stopped the sound
 m    |            2 | จันทร์    | n   | Moon        |  347

ditto dri is final cluster, d stops the sound ri is silent
 m    |            2 | กษัตริย์   | n   | king        |  154

weird, what is the h doing in here
 m    |            2 | พราหมณ์  | n   | Brahman     |  787

พราหมณ์	phraamM		leading cluster pr, final cluster silent h+m, silent mark
