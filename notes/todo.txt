edit/insert - do lookup first, if object supplied

lookup
	no input, error message in sam chat "lookup what?" 
	not found, error message in sam chat "not found"

sam
svc
editor

syntax of lookup and edit should be the same except for -new

specify language requirement on each field
allow only thai in thai field, and components
allow only eng in other fields

handler when focus on manual components for type o

db testing starts with sequence ids here
select * from mai.mean where id > 1365;
select * from mai.dict where id > 1465;

support column rules
implement parse, auto and manual


after db update
	download a new copy of the fastdict
	implement fastdict within parseString()

noam.html
test1 - ไมตรี
	noam.parse -> noam.parseStory -> noam.parseString 
	return an array of word objects, each word object has dict or false

parse -syllable ไม
parse -syllable ตรี
parse -string ไมตรี
edit ไม : save (update)
edit -new ตรี : save (insert)
edit -new ไมตรี : save (insert)

make parsing on server vs client decisions
	keep small array on client, words only
	anything using dict arrays has to be replaced or moved to server

=====================================

postreq
	reimplement sengen
	include sengen within noam?
		noam::parse() 400 lines
		noam::collectWords() 75 lines
		sengen::genSentence() 300 lines
		sengen::constructor incl buildSemantics() 40 lines
	noam.js
	parse.js
	sengen.js
	grammar.js

vet level 
	count glyphs total vs mastered, flag missing from dict
	count words total vs mastered, flag missing from dict

determine appropriateness of a course-level-story
	count glyphs, new vs mastered
	count words, new vs mastered
	when.  when drawing courselist?

globalization
	string management
		all strings must be held in two languages
		if mastered, display in thai
		else display in english
	optional implementation: to display any page
		find texts on the page (always english)
		translate to thai
		lookup in vocab
		if in vocab, use thai

names in conversations
	aka dialogs 
	most common thai nicknames
	persons:
		self: name, age, gender

lesson 3 ring fingers and pinkies, phrase: hair beautiful

write dynamic translit function in Dictionary or Noam.  Current translit function in Dictionary is static.

consonant cluster after leading upright vowel, positions reversed

consonant cluster, inherent short a, two syllables
	if first consonant high and second low, low becomes high
	examples tanon, kanom, samud

silent tone mark
	เกณฑ์

silent i on final consonant
	examples Suvarnabhumi, Bhumibol

loi, at all

trailing อ
	ถือ
	มือ
	ชื่อ
	หนังสือ	

อ = aw or silent, is it in position of vowel or consonant?
lc = อ, consonant placeholder, skip translit of lc, vowel only
psql -U voyccom_jhagstrand -d voyccom_mai -c "select * from  mai.thaidict where substring(thai,1,1) = 'อ';"

psql -U voyccom_jhagstrand -d voyccom_mai -c "select id, thai, level, details from mai.thaidict where pos = '' and eng = '' and details != '';"




parse
pos, eng
translit table: given lc, vp, fc, tn per syllable; what about multi-syllable words?
implement translit as separate function
if there is a final consonant, there must also be an endx rule


translit of lc comes from dictionary
translit of fc comes from rules
translit of vowels comes from vowel pattern table
tone calculation can be fixed
translit can be table driven and customizeable
add รร to vowel pattern table
translit table


consonant cluster, presence of tonemark unclusters these consonants
final cluster nt, t has to be silent because n as already stopped the sound
 m    |            2 | จันทร์    | n   | Moon        |  347

ditto dri is final cluster, d stops the sound ri is silent
 m    |            2 | กษัตริย์   | n   | king        |  154

weird, what is the h doing in here
 m    |            2 | พราหมณ์  | n   | Brahman     |  787


ทรัพย์
จันทร์
ราษฎร์

ทรัพย์	sapH	tr => s
จันทร์	janM	fc is cluster of two
ราษฎร์	raatF	fc is cluster of two
เบอร์	buuhrM	pronunciation?
พราหมณ์	phraamM		leading cluster pr, final cluster silent h+m, silent mark
จอห์น	jaawnM	silent consonant is NOT the last letter in the word
