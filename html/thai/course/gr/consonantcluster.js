<h1>Consonant Cluster</h1>
<h2>True Consonant Cluster</h2>
<p>Two or more consonants combined into a single sound.
An english-speaker might call this a dipthong, like cry, swell, bloat.</p>
<p>In Thai, the first consonant will be one of ก, ข, ค, ต, ป, ผ, or พ. And the second consonant will be ร, ล, or ว.  
These consonants are considered "compatible", meaning they can easily be combined together into a single sound.</p>
<p>The class of the first consonant of the cluster becomes the class of the cluster.  
Tonemarks and subposed and superposed vowel diacritics are applied to the last consonant in the cluster.</p>

<h2>False Consonant Cluster</h2>
In what is called a "false" cluster, the first consonant is one of จ, ซ, ท, ส, or ศ.  
And the second consonant in the cluster is always ร, and it is silent. These consonants are considered "incompatible".  i
That is, it is not possible to combine the j sound and the r sound into a single sound.
Nor is it possible to combine s+r or t+r, though the English-speaker will disagree.
~~ru=ccfalse~~

<h2>False Consonant Cluster: tr to s</h2>
The combination of ท and ร is a special case of the false consonant cluster. Not only is the ร silent, but the ท is pronounced as "s". 
ทรัพย์	sapH	tr => s
~~ru=cctr2s~~

<h2>Enepenthetic Consonant Cluster</h2>
<p>Another way to pronounce incompatible consonants is to insert a short "a" vowel sound between them, creating an additional syllable.
This is called an "enepenthetic" cluster.</p> 
~~ru=ccenep~~

<h2>Inherent Vowel short a</h2>
<p>Sometimes the short a vowel sound is applied to a single standalone consonant.</p>
~~ru=ccivas~~

<h2>Inherent Vowel short o</h2>
<p>Sometimes a pair of consonants side-by-side is not intended as a cluster, 
but as a leading consonant followed by a final consonant with an "inherent" short "o" vowel sound between them.</p>
~~ru=ccivo~~

<h2>Final Consonant Cluster</h2>
<p>All of the cases above refer to clusters occurring in the leading consonant position.
But clusters sometimes occur in the final cluster position.</p>
The pronunciation rule is simple here.  The first consonant stops the sound, so any following consonants are silent.</p>
For example, in the word จันทร์, the word for moon, จ is the leading consonant and นท is the final consonant cluster.
The น sound stops the sound of the syllable, so the ท is silent.
จันทร์	janM	fc is cluster of two
ราษฎร์	raatF	fc is cluster of two
~~ru=ccfinal~~

<h2>Combinations</h2>
<p>For example the word for king, กษัตริย์ has three rules applied.</p>
~~กษัตริย์,xxx~~


<h2>weird, what is the h doing in here</h2>
 m    |            2 | พราหมณ์  | n   | Brahman     |  787
~~ru=????~~

<h2>Silent Consonants</h2>
<p>While on the subject of consonants, note that "garaan" symbol makes a consonant silent explicitly.</p>


<h2>leading consonant clusters with leading ห or อ</h2>


<h2>Final Consonant Sound</h2>
six ending sounds:
	live  /-n/, /-ng/, or /-m/
	dead  /-k/, /-p/, or /-t/

<h2>Reduplication</h2>
<p>A single consonant is used twice, as the 
			end of the previous syllable, and 
			beginning of the next</p>
		นัยนา  นัย ย นา    ย used twice, Naiyana
		วิทยาลัย  วิท ท ยาลัย
