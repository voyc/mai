reading notes

"I was confused and ashamed at how out of control my desire had been."
"I made a commitment to Jesus."
Bruce Cockburn: Rumours of Glory, 2014, Describing the shame of his natural sexuality, and subsequent born again experience.

"Roman Polanski’s psychotic film Repulsion, which, coincidentally, became an important and disturbing contributor to my youthful self-analysis."
The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan hit Ottawa in the summer of 1963, our little group of folkies all had to learn “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right,” “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Hard Rain,” and “Masters of War”.
“Desolation Row,” from Highway 61 Revisited, came out in 1965, and in my mind it remains one of the best songs ever written. The following year Dylan released Blonde on Blonde, with “Visions of Johanna” and “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.” No one has ever written songs better than these.
Bruce Cockburn: Rumours of Glory, 2014

"You’re married to a whore, Beaghler, get used to it. Either put her on the street to bring home some money, or get rid of her. But stop trying to turn her into the little woman, it won’t work.”
-- Richard Stark: Plunder Squad, a Parker novel

See the contradictions, the incongruities, the falsehood and the sorrow of the human state, the need to go beyond.
— Nisargadatta Maharaj: I Am That

The three “poisons”—anger, desire, and ignorance—all die, which means that all the negative emotions, the root of samsara, actually cease, and then there is a gap.
— Sogyal Rinpoche: The Tibetan Book Of Living And Dying

Now, Google is going further: Google expects its BERT systems to factor into about one in ten search results - a significant proportion for a technology that was published as a research paper less than a year ago. 
What is BERT and why does this matter?: BERT, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, was released by Google in October 2018, and quickly generated attention by getting impressive scores on a range of different tasks, ranging from question-answering to language inference. BERT is part of a crop of recent NLP models (GPT, GPT2, ULMFiT, roBERTa, etc) that have all demonstrated significant performance improvements over prior systems, leading to some researchers saying that NLP is having its "ImageNet moment".

How can we distinguish these and avoid judgement.

The pussy will take the vulnerable child and run away, or slink away, suffering humiliation and shame rather than risk the child in a confrontation of some kind.
Maybe that is not so cowardly after all.

to me

Marshall Rosenberg
judges violence as bad, compassion as good
Anger, depression guilt shame
Anger put on someone else
depression guilt shame put on oneself
Power over someone - reward, punishment
Power with someone - increases their desire to contribute to our well-being
Love is not a feeling, it is a need
To observe without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence. -Krishnamurti
